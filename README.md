In the project, I first came up with the hardware and software layouts to match my objectives.
The objective was to react by slowing down and eventually stop when a certain distance from obstacle is reached.
the slow down distace for the model is 30cm and stop distance is 10cm.
To test other functonalities of the mcu, a dislay is included to show the distance from obstacle and dislay stop when stopped.
A buzzer is also turned on when the slow down begins.
